In September 2018, through circumstances shaped by availability in his rotational program, Fernando found himself moving to Louisville, KY, instead of the other option, Chicago, IL. Little did he know, this change would become a pivotal moment in his life.</p><p>A few months later while on a trip to Mexico, Jenn rekindled her love for Latin music, a passion that led her to seek out salsa dancing lessons as soon as she returned home. She began attending classes and social dances held on Wednesdays at Play—a decision that would serendipitously align with Fernando's path.</p><p>Come January 2, 2019, Fernando, looking to broaden his horizons, made the choice to step out and immerse himself in the world of salsa. He discovered that Play also hosted lessons and a social dance every Wednesday. It was at this local bar, on the dance floor, where the rhythm of salsa would orchestrate the steps leading Jenn and Fer into each other's lives.</p>"

Jen says the tree-lined neighborhoods feel a lot like Louisville, KY — where she lived before moving to Michigan.</p><p>The summers here are absolutely perfect — especially after waiting all winter long. If you have the extra time, we highly recommend extending your trip and visiting Lake Michigan, or even venturing north to the UP (Upper Penninsula).</p>",
