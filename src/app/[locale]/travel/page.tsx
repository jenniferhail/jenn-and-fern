          Ann Arbor is a beautiful college town only 40 minutes west of Detroit.
          Jen says the tree-lined neighborhoods feel a lot like Louisville, KY.
          We&apos;ve lived here for three years and have a list of our favorite
          spots (see our Things To Do page for more), but there are still so
          many on our wish list.
        </p>
        <p>
          The summers here are absolutely perfect â€” especially after waiting all
          winter long. If you have the extra time, we highly recommend extending
          your trip and visiting Lake Michigan, or even venturing north to the
          UP (Upper Penninsula).

        <h2>Getting Here</h2>
        <p>
          The simplest way for many of you will be to fly into DTW and Uber/Lyft
          to AA or rent a car for full control over your journey. Please let us
          know if you&apos;d like to find a group for splitting car or Airbnb
          rentals.
        </p>

          If you&apos;re the adventurous type, you can fly into Chicago and take
          the Amtrak from Union Station to Ann Arbor. We took the trip for the
          first time in March and it&apos;s really lovely, only around 4 hours
          and no TSA required. Plan to arrive on Friday if you want to go this
          route.
        </p>
        <h2>Lodging</h2>
        <p>
          We recommend staying within a 10-15 minute drive of our ceremony and
          reception venues. Here are a few options, or you can search for a
          place to stay on Airbnb.
